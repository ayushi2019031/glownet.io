Hi! I’m **Ayushi Jain**, a Software Engineer at Microsoft with a curious mind, a passion for building intelligent systems, and a knack for solving real-world problems using AI.

Currently, I work in Azure, where I’ve contributed to building **multi-agent CoPilot experiences**, scalable automation for **cloud services across 20+ regions**, and secure **B2B authentication systems**. My journey here started as an intern, where I built distributed ML pipelines using PySpark and Databricks, and I’ve grown since then into a full-time engineer working across infra, DevOps, and AI-driven user experiences.

Before Microsoft, I graduated from **IIIT Delhi** with a B.Tech in Computer Science (CGPA: 8.34). My academic interests gravitated toward **distributed systems**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning**, which I continue to explore through certifications (Stanford’s XCS234 & XCS236, Azure AI Engineer Associate) and independent research.

One of my proudest academic contributions is a paper I co-authored: *“Erasing Labor with Labor”*, presented at **ACM HT ’22**, which examined dark patterns in app design across 300k reviews and millions of installs. The project used a combination of data scraping, clustering, and UX analysis to uncover manipulative behaviors in popular mobile apps.

Outside work, I love experimenting with **Generative AI** — from implementing **CycleGANs** for artistic image transformation to participating in Kaggle’s creative ML competitions. I document my projects and learnings on this blog, not just to keep track of my growth, but also to make AI more accessible to fellow learners and builders.

This site is powered by curiosity, late-night ideas, and the belief that knowledge grows when shared.
