Hi! Iâ€™m **Ayushi Jain**, a Software Engineer at Microsoft with a curious mind, a passion for building intelligent systems, and a knack for solving real-world problems using AI.

Currently, I work in Azure, where Iâ€™ve contributed to building **multi-agent CoPilot experiences**, scalable automation for **cloud services across 20+ regions**, and secure **B2B authentication systems**. My journey here started as an intern, where I built distributed ML pipelines using PySpark and Databricks, and Iâ€™ve grown since then into a full-time engineer working across infra, DevOps, and AI-driven user experiences.

Before Microsoft, I graduated from **IIIT Delhi** with a B.Tech in Computer Science (CGPA: 8.34). My academic interests gravitated toward **distributed systems**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning**. I continue to explore through university based courses (Stanfordâ€™s XCS234 & XCS236), Azure certifications and independent research.

Outside work, I love to read fiction and non-fiction books. I document my projects and learnings on this blog, not just to keep track of my growth, but also to make AI more accessible to fellow learners and builders.

This site is powered by curiosity and the belief that knowledge grows when shared.
