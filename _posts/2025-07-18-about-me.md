Hi! I'm Ayushi — a software engineer, AI enthusiast, and curious mind passionate about making machine learning more accessible.

By day, I work on building intelligent systems and scalable infrastructure. By night (and weekends), I dive into generative models, tinker with Kaggle competitions, and write about my experiments with GANs, transformers, and other magical things from the world of AI.

This blog is where I document what I learn, build, and sometimes break — with the hope that it might light the way for someone else. ✨

You’ll find technical articles, project breakdowns, and explorations into how deep learning models work under the hood.

Feel free to reach out, collaborate, or just say hi!
